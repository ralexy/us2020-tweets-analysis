# US Election trends - M1 Computer Science project

The goal of this project is to compute and extract syntaxtic informations about tweets posted on the 2020 US Election.  
We created a website to provide a very quick glimpse on this data.

## Tools used
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) with [the open-source library spaCy](https://spacy.io) to interprete tweets
* [ijson](https://github.com/isagalaev/ijson), a Python library to read JSON as a stream,
* [D3 Cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud), a JavaScript library to produce words clouds,
* [PHP](https://www.php.net) [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org) to create a dynamic website and store datas in a database
* We don't forget to mention *awk*, *sed* and *cat* who are a very powerful commands to handle huge files fastly.

## Students Involved
